# cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-jenkins

This is a simple train schedule app written using nodejs. It is intended to be used as a sample application for a series of hands-on learning activities. Manoj has tried to use the same to test end to end connection testing between git, jenkins to trigger automatic build runs.

## Running the app

You need a Java JDK 7 or later to run the build. You can run the build like this:

    ./gradlew build

You can run the app with:

    ./gradlew npm_start

Once it is running, you can access it in a browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
